# im andrew/whatever you know me as
### This is my school github account, my personal one (which is far less active than this one currently) can be found [here](https://github.com/stupidjuice)

This account was originally just for robotics, but now it's kinda just my new account.

Fun facts about me:
- im ticklish
- i've been coding for 4 years (remind me to update this in june)
- C#'s my favorite language
